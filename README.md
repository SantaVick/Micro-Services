This project showcases a Microservices Architecture for an E-commerce Platform. It demonstrates the implementation of core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations across independently deployed and scalable services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain (such as product management, order handling, user accounts, etc.), illustrating how modular design can enhance flexibility, maintainability, and scalability in real-world applications.
